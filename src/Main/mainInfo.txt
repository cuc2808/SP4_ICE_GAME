There is use of RyiSnow's tutorial on YouTube. He does it completely simple and good.



===== Main =====

1. We want to open a window in java that can display some graphic.
2. We start by creating a new JFrame objective after importing the package JFrame.
3. Afterward we add parameters necessary for opening a window with the right preferences.

6. We then add the Game Panel to the window. By creating a GamePanel instance then adding it to the window.
7. By using .pack we can set the window to our prefences and see the window on screen


===== Game Panel =====
4. We then proceed to create a new Class called GamePanel, to determine the size of the game and tiles, that the game consists of.
5. Then we add the attributes to the tiles and then to the resolution to the GamePanel.

8. Now we can open the window, but it's mostly static, and since a game usually is running in 60 fps, we gotta get it running.
9. We start by adding a THREAD called gameThread and Implements "Runnable" in the class.
10. We then add a startGameThread() method that instantiated the Thread with .this which is our GamePanel class.
11. Now we start the thread that then calls the implemented run method.
12. We then wanna keep the thread running and therefor creates a While loop in the run method
13. In run, we add a while loop that runs as long as there is something to run.

What we want here is two things:
- Update information... fx. player position and so forth.
- Draw the game with the updated information. That is pretty cool.
14. We start by adding two new methods. A method called Update, Then a paintComponent()
